Astrophysics I homework

MZW.py calculates root of Legendre Polynomials for n = 3 and n = 4 and their weights to a atm_szar_a.dat file. It also generates root for W(k) equation for Chandrasekhar's method to solve grey atmosphere

warbrzeg.py calculates boundary values for the same problem (general solution) and leaves them in atm_szar_b.dat file
